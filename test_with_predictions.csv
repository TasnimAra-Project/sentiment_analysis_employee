Re:,"traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip. especially if you have to prepare a presentation. i would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings. i would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary. as far as the business meetings, i think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not. too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn. the meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format. my suggestion for where to go is austin. play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's. flying somewhere takes too much time.",4/21/2010,sally.beck@enron.com,Positive,0.5187433958053589

Re: FW: LNG Weekly Update,"looks good. certainly an area we need more focus on. obviously the most important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in, what is that relative to last year, and what new capacity is coming longer term. as an aside, nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year and five year averages. it would be very useful if all fundamental analysis were geared the same way. the fact that lng shipments are x this week is meaningless. the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely useful. if you noticed in the fundies meeting, i was trying to move discussion that way. what's switching vis a vis last year. whats production relative to last year. it simplifies the fundamental analysis. from: jennifer fraser/enron@enronxgate on 03/12/2001 05:46 pm",6/22/2011,eric.bass@enron.com,Positive,0.8297041654586792

FINAL DECISION ON ACCRUAL VALUE,"tom has come to a decision on what to do with the ubiquitous accrual value. 60% of this value should be credited to greg's transport expense on a monthly basis. tom, in turn, will cover ed on this portion of the expense. for example: accrual value comes out to be $300,000 for the month of april. this means that: greg's portion of this value is 60% of $300,000 = $180,000 tom's portion of this value is 40% of $300,000 = $120,000 greg's transport expense is ($700,000) so, tom will cover $180,000 of this expense greg's adjusted expense is ($520,000) greg's p&l is net better off by the $180,000 of accrual value tom's p&l is net better off by $120,000 of accrual value which had not been previously recognized. ed's p&l is net unchanged from all of the above. call with questions. eric x3-0977",9/27/2011,eric.bass@enron.com,Neutral,0.8427963852882385

A note on PMA's,"you may notice that 9911 pma's are $(208,881) or approx 10% to the final p&l. you will also notice that the detail following the majority of the adjustments is unaccounted for gas. at the close of business for the 991 p&l, we saw a gain of approx. $250,000 because of a blowout in ua4. we thought that it would be prudent to top level this amount and use it to offset the pma's we would take as a result of this ua4 blowout. therefore, the net impact of 9911 pma's is $41,119 or 2% of last day p&l. i just wanted to congratulate the team on a great p&l for the month of november. -eric",8/8/2010,patti.thompson@enron.com,Neutral,0.7633378505706787
